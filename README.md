**WT32-ETH01 Offline-First LAN Gateway**

`beach-net` is a firmware project for the **WT32-ETH01** that turns the device into a **self-contained LAN gateway** for a remote beach house with **no permanent internet connection**.

The system is designed to work **100% offline**, with **optional internet access** provided later via a mobile phone hotspot.

                        Mobile / Laptop
```

### Key Principles

* **Offline-first**: LAN operates with no WAN
* **Single gateway**: WT32 is always `172.18.1.1`
* **Ethernet + WiFi AP = same LAN**
* **Security hardware is autonomous** (ESP32 alarm system)
* **Optional WAN** via phone hotspot (added later)

## 🧠 Device Roles

| Device         | Role                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| WT32-ETH01     | LAN gateway, WiFi AP, future WAN router |
| Raspberry Pi   | Flask frontend, security UI, services   |
| ESP32 (Alarm)  | PIR + alarm control (hardware enforced) |
| Phone / Laptop | Admin & monitoring clients              |

---

## 🌐 Network Configuration

* **Subnet:** `172.18.1.0/24`
* **Gateway:** `172.18.1.1` (WT32)
* **Raspberry Pi:** `172.18.1.10` (static)
* **Alarm ESP32:** `172.18.1.240` (static)
* **DHCP clients:** `172.18.1.100+`

The WT32 is the **authoritative gateway** for all LAN devices.

---

## 📦 Features (Current)

* Ethernet LAN with static IP
* WiFi Access Point (DHCP enabled)
* Unified LAN across Ethernet + WiFi
* mDNS discovery (`wt32-beach-gateway.local`)
* Serial diagnostics
* Safe for remote, unattended operation

---

## 🚧 Planned Features

* WiFi STA mode (connect to iPhone hotspot)
* NAT + IP forwarding
* DNS forwarding / fallback
* WAN status detection
* OTA firmware updates
* Watchdog & recovery logic

---

## 🔧 Build & Flashing

### Requirements

* WT32-ETH01
* USB-to-Serial (FTDI / CP2102 / CH340)
* **3.3V logic only**
* External 3.3V regulator recommended

### Flashing Notes

* WT32 has **no USB**
* Flashing requires:

  * `IO0 → GND` during power-up
  * Serial baud: `115200`
* Ethernet **cannot** be used for first flash

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All site-specific configuration lives in:

```
env.h
```

Including:

* Device ID
* LAN IP settings
* WiFi AP credentials
* Debug enable

This keeps `main.cpp` clean and reusable.

---

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

After flashing:

* [ ] Serial output visible at 115200 baud
* [ ] WiFi AP `BeachHouse-Secure` visible
* [ ] Able to reach `http://172.18.1.10` (Pi)
* [ ] mDNS responds: `wt32-beach-gateway.local`
* [ ] Alarm ESP32 reachable at `172.18.1.240`

---

## 🛡️ Design Philosophy

* **Stability over cleverness**
* **No cloud dependency**
* **Explicit configuration**
* **Field-serviceable**
* **Predictable failure modes**

This system is designed to behave like a **professional remote security LAN**, not a consumer router.

## 🌍 WAN via WiFi STA (Mobile Hotspot)

The WT32-ETH01 is designed to optionally provide **internet access** to the LAN by connecting as a **WiFi STA (client)** to a mobile phone hotspot.

This WAN connection is **non-authoritative** and may appear or disappear at any time without affecting LAN operation.

### Design Rules

* LAN **never changes**
* WT32 remains gateway at `172.18.1.1`
* WAN is **NATed**
* LAN devices never talk to the phone directly

### Network Model

```
LAN (always on)
172.18.1.0/24
gateway: 172.18.1.1
        |
   +------------+
   | WT32-ETH01 |
   |   NAT      |
   +------------+
        |
   WiFi STA (WAN)
        |
  iPhone Hotspot
```

### Expected WAN Behavior

* WT32 joins the phone hotspot as a **client**
* WT32 receives a dynamic WAN IP (e.g. `192.168.x.x`)
* All outbound LAN traffic is NATed
* No inbound WAN traffic is allowed
* LAN services continue uninterrupted if WAN drops

### Use Cases

* Software updates
* SSH access
* Remote diagnostics
* Time sync (NTP)

### Non-Goals

* Bridging phone hotspot into LAN
* Exposing LAN devices to the phone
* Cloud dependency for core functionality

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> Internet access is considered **optional convenience**, not a system dependency.
